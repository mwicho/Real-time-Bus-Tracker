# Real-time-Bus-tracker
This program utilizes Geojson syntax and js to cycle through a certain number of Bus stops between the MIT campus and Harvard
Go ahead and fork and clone this repo to your machine to see it in action!
<h2> Future Roadmap </h2>
<p> As I continue to work on this program, I hope to incorporate data from the MBTA's API to get access to more bus data and actually track the buses locations and show it in Real time! </p>
